# problem
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Example
Example 1:

MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1 // return 1.00000
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2 // return 5.50000
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3 // return 4.66667
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3 // return 6.00000

# idea

this solution has a time complexity of O(k) per operation, where k is the window size. This means that the time required to calculate the moving average increases linearly with the window size. Therefore, this solution may not be optimal for very large window sizes.
