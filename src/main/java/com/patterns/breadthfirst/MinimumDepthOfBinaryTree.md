Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# idea

When the left or right child of the root is null. If one of them is null, we return the minimum depth of the other subtree plus 1.
the time complexity is O(n)
