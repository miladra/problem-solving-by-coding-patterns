Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a
multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 5000
0 <= Node.val <= 1000

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?

# idea

The solution I provided is a recursive solution to the problem.
It works by first counting the number of nodes in the current group of k nodes.
If the count is equal to k, it means that there are enough nodes to reverse.
The function then calls itself recursively with the next group of k nodes as input. After the
